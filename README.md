Some small projects I made for an old friend...

!A comprehensive convertor, that is hopefully faster than using Google to find each individual answer. 

Convert Time, Length and Weight.

Instructions on how to convert are also available.

!A factor finder, that is hopefully much faster than a calculator or a brain!

find any positive numbers factors.

Handy for Maths revision...
